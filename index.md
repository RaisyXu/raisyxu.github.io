</p>

I'm a fintech professional with a strong foundation in **Data analytics**, **Product Analytics**, **quantitative strategy**, and **Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)** innovation. With a Master's in Business Analytics from Washington University in St. Louis and over 3 years of experience at **JPMorgan Chase**, I've led impactful work in digital finance and product development.

## 🚀 Project Updates

Here are my latest projects exploring data science, machine learning, and product analytics in fintech and delivery platforms:

## 📢 Project Updates

- **✈️⚾ MLB Flight & Transportation Time Series Analysis (2025)**  
  Conducted a **time series analysis** on MLB team travel schedules and jet fuel price data to uncover scheduling inefficiencies and cost implications.  
  - Found that a **$0.50/gal fuel price increase** could raise league-wide travel costs by **~$12.3M annually**.  
  - Identified **West Coast teams travel 21% more miles** than East Coast teams → higher exposure to price volatility.  
  - Simulated scheduling optimizations showing potential **6.5% travel reduction**.  
  - Built visuals of **fuel price trends, monthly flight frequency, and travel distance distribution**.  
  > 💡 Designed this project to strengthen my **pricing analytics skillset**, linking cost forecasting to decision-making.
