## 📢 Project Updates

Here are my latest projects exploring data science, machine learning, and product analytics in fintech and delivery platforms:

### 🗂️❄️📈 dbt + Snowflake + Airflow ELT Pipeline (Added 09/2025)

- 🎯 **Objective:** Built an **end-to-end ELT pipeline** to demonstrate modern data stack skills with **dbt**, **Snowflake**, and **Airflow (Cosmos)**.  
- 📊 **Result:** Modeled raw TPCH data into **business-ready fact tables and views** (`FCT_ORDERS`, `INT_ORDER_ITEMS_SUMMARY`) and automated refreshes through Airflow DAGs.  
- 🔍 **Highlights:** Enforced data quality with dbt schema + custom tests; showcased orchestration in a **production-like Snowflake environment**.
