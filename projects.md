# üìÇ Selected Projects

Here are a few key projects showcasing my work across fintech strategy, product analytics, and digital optimization:

---

### ‚úàÔ∏è‚öæ MLB Flight & Transportation Time Series Analysis

- **Objective:** Analyzed Major League Baseball (MLB) team travel schedules and integrated jet fuel price data to explore trends, cost structures, and scheduling optimizations.  
- **Techniques Used:** Time Series Analysis, Scenario Modeling, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Key Results:**  
  - Found that a **$0.50/gal fuel price increase** could raise league-wide travel costs by **~$12.3M annually**.  
  - Identified that **West Coast teams travel 21% more miles** than East Coast teams, leading to uneven cost exposures.  
  - Simulation showed **optimizing double-headers** could cut travel by **6.5%**.  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Generated visual insights on **fuel price trends**, **monthly flight frequency**, and **travel distance distribution**.  
  - Connected time series volatility to **pricing and risk management strategies**, aligning with my preparation for pricing-related roles.  
- **GitHub Repository:** [View Project](https://github.com/RaisyXu/mlb_flight_analysis)

### üìä Predicting Property Listing Interactions with Machine Learning

- **Objective:** Built machine learning models to predict how many interactions (views, saves, inquiries) a property listing will receive over 3 days and 7 days, based on property features.
- **Techniques Used:** Feature Engineering, Random Forest, LightGBM, Hyperparameter Tuning, Residual Analysis, SHAP Explainability, Streamlit App Deployment.
- **Key Results:** Achieved **R¬≤ = 0.995** for 7-day interaction prediction using Random Forest, with low MAE and RMSE.
- **Highlights:** Developed a full model evaluation dashboard (Actual vs Predicted, Residual Distribution, Feature Importances) and deployed a Streamlit app for live prediction.

### üõµ Predicting Delivery Time Using DoorDash Historical Data

Built a machine learning model to predict **actual delivery time** for DoorDash orders using a dataset of historical deliveries across multiple U.S. cities.

- Processed and engineered features from **80K+ delivery records**, including time, location, store, and order details
- Created custom time-based features and handled noisy/missing timestamps using Python and pandas
- Trained and tuned a **Random Forest Regressor** using `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize delivery time predictions
- Achieved **RMSE under 5 minutes** on validation data and identified top features: `market_id`, `created_at`, and `order_protocol`
- Visualized feature importances and delivery time distributions to support operational improvements
